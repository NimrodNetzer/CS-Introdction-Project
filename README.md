# 📘 Introduction to Computer Science – Final Project

**Author**: Nimrod Netzer  

This project was developed as part of an introductory computer science course. It is a comprehensive, menu-driven C application that showcases fundamental programming concepts including:

- Base conversion and arithmetic
- Recursion
- Dynamic memory management
- Custom data structures (linked lists)
- Menu systems with function pointers

---

## 📂 Features

### 🧮 Basic Operations
- Convert from base **2–9** to decimal and vice versa
- Binary number addition (formatted output)
- Prime factorization
- Symmetric diamond pattern printing

### 🔁 Recursion
- Print strings in reverse (recursively)
- Print all **N-digit** numbers where the absolute difference between adjacent digits is **K**
- Find subset of an array summing to a target value
- Identify the longest increasing subarray

### 📊 Data Structures
- Manage a dynamic **User Database** containing:
  - Multiple users
  - Series lists per user
  - Ordered episodes per series
- Add users, series, episodes
- Print and clean the entire database
- Demonstrates use of:
  - Linked lists
  - Recursive sorting
  - Dynamic memory allocation with `malloc`, `realloc`, and `free`

## 🖥️ How to Run

1. Compile the code using a C compiler:
   ```bash
   gcc ex_10.c -o ex_10
